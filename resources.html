        <h3>SPORTS/CLUBS</h3>
        <p>
          Sports and clubs are important to our community because it offers
          people a safe and secure environment to build friendships, exercise,
          and learn new skills. Participation in sports is linked to higher
          grades, lower dropout rates, and lower crime rates. Clubs can help
          with communication skills, foster creative thinking, and teach you how
          to work with others effectively. Some of the sports and clubs we offer
          are soccer, basketball, baseball, book club, anime club, and pottery
          club. Please email us at helpershub@gmail.com to learn how you can
          join one of our sports teams or clubs.

        <h3>COMMUNITY FOOD PANTRY</h3>
        <p>
          Helpers Hub offers a food pantry and weekly food drives for people in
          our community. This was possible through donations from local grocery
          stores, churches, and members of our community. Did you know that food
          insecurity affects more than 38 million individuals in the United
          States, including 12 million children? Hunger, however, does not
          affect everyone equally; some groups, such as children, seniors, and
          Black, Indigenous, and other people of color, have substantially
          higher rates of hunger. Check out our calendar to learn when upcoming
          food drives will be happening and follow us on social media to find
          out how you can get involved.

        <h3>CHILD CARE</h3>
        <p>
          A big issue in our community is finding affordable child care for
          families. According to a BPC/Morning Consult survey conducted in
          October 2019, nearly one-third of families earning less than $50,000 a
          year find it extremely difficult to pay for child care, compared to
          only 10% of high-income families. In addition, according to the
          survey, 67 percent of low-income families reduced their expenditure on
          necessities like food and transportation to pay for child care. These
          alarming statistics are why we are excited to announce that we are now
          offering free child care at our center. Click here to fill out a child
          care form.

        <h3>DRUG ABUSE EDUCATION PROGRAM</h3>
        <p>
          One of the programs we offer here at Helpers Hub community center is a
          drug abuse education program. Studies have shown that teenagers and
          people with mental health disorders are at a higher risk for drug use
          and addiction than any other group. We believe this program can play a
          big part in preventing potential drug and substance abuse in our
          community's youth. Check out our calendar page to find out what days
          classes are available.
